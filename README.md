This repository includes an EXE file and a PY file. The PY file is the raw code that I created for this project, and the EXE is the fully packaged file that is shipped.
This program takes a low value and high value from the user, as well as an input key.
Pressing Start begins the keyboard capture, which only looks for the inputted key to be pressed.
Pressing the key swaps the system volume between the two inputs that the user provided
Stop ends the listening
